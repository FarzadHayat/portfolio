A third-person adventure game made for Android.  
The goal is to rescue the hostages and lead them to the exit.  
This game was made in 2019 as a school project between Toby Tinker and myself.  
My role was programming and level design.  
Toby's role was modelling and textures.  
This game was made using Unity3D, C#, and Magicavoxel.
