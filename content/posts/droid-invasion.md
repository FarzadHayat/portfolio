A first-person shooter game made for Windows.
The goal is to kill enemy droids and survive as long as possible.
This game was made in 2018 as a school project between Farzad Hayatbakhsh and Toby Tinker.
My role was programming and level design.
Toby's role was modelling and textures.
This game was made using Unity3D, C# and Blender.
