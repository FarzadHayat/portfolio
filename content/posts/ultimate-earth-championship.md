A turn-based player-vs-computer game made for Windows.

Aliens have invaded Earth and ressurected the greatest of humanity back to life to battle each other in the intergalactic sports tournament.
You are to create a team of up to 9 champions, provide them with weapons, and fight against other teams in a checkered style battle arena.
The other teams intelligently fight each other and make purchases from the market in the background to create a realistic battling system.

Made using Java with the Swing GUI Toolkit in the Eclipse IDE.
We utilized JUnit for unit testing and UML diagrams for planning.
