      <description>Demo Video
A third-person adventure game made for Android.
The goal is to rescue the hostages and lead them to the exit.
This game was made in 2019 as a school project between Toby Tinker and myself.
My role was programming and level design.
Toby&amp;rsquo;s role was modelling and textures.
This game was made using Unity3D, C#, and Magicavoxel.
